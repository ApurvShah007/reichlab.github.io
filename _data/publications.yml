  abstract: >
    Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), a severe manifestation of dengue viral infection that can cause severe bleeding, organ impairment, and even death, affects between 15,000 and 105,000 people each year in Thailand. While all Thai provinces experience at least one DHF case most years, the distribution of cases shifts regionally from year to year. Accurately forecasting where DHF outbreaks occur before the dengue season could help public health officials prioritize public health activities. We develop statistical models that use biologically plausible covariates, observed by April each year, to forecast the cumulative DHF incidence for the remainder of the year. We perform cross-validation during the training phase (2000–2009) to select the covariates for these models. A parsimonious model based on preseason incidence outperforms the 10-y median for 65% of province-level annual forecasts, reduces the mean absolute error by 19%, and successfully forecasts outbreaks (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.84) over the testing period (2010–2014). We find that functions of past incidence contribute most strongly to model performance, whereas the importance of environmental covariates varies regionally. This work illustrates that accurate forecasts of dengue risk are possible in a policy-relevant timeframe.

    Accurate and reliable predictions of infectious disease dynamics can be
    valuable to public health organizations that plan interventions to decrease
    or prevent disease transmission. A great variety of models have been
    developed for this task, using different model structures, covariates, and
    targets for prediction. Experience has shown that the performance of these
    models varies; some tend to do better or worse in different seasons or at
    different points within a season. Ensemble methods combine multiple models
    to obtain a single prediction that leverages the strengths of each model. We
    considered a range of ensemble methods that each form a predictive density
    for a target of interest as a weighted sum of the predictive densities from
    component models. In the simplest case, equal weight is assigned to each
    component model; in the most complex case, the weights vary with the region,
    prediction target, week of the season when the predictions are made, a
    measure of component model uncertainty, and recent observations of disease
    incidence. We applied these methods to predict measures of influenza season
    timing and severity in the United States, both at the national and regional
    levels, using three component models. We trained the models on retrospective
    predictions from 14 seasons (1997/1998 - 2010/2011) and evaluated each
    model's prospective, out-of-sample performance in the five subsequent
    influenza seasons. In this test phase, the ensemble methods showed overall
    performance that was similar to the best of the component models, but
    offered more consistent performance across seasons than the component
    models. Ensemble methods offer the potential to deliver more reliable
    predictions to public health decision makers.

    Preprints—manuscripts posted openly online prior to peer review—offer an opportunity to accelerate the dissemination of scientific findings to support responses to infectious disease outbreaks.
    Preprints posted during the Ebola and Zika outbreaks included novel analyses and new data, and most of those that were matched to peer-reviewed publications were available more than 100 days before publication.
    Despite the advantages of preprints and the endorsement of journals and funders in the context of outbreaks, less than 5% of Ebola and Zika journal articles were posted as preprints prior to publication in journals.
    With broader adoption by scientists, journals, and funding agencies, preprints can complement peer-reviewed publication and ensure the early, open, and transparent dissemination of science relevant to the prevention and control of disease outbreaks.

  abstract: >
    During outbreaks of deadly emerging pathogens (e.g., Ebola, MERS-CoV) and bioterror threats (e.g., smallpox), actively monitoring potentially infected individuals aims to limit disease transmission and morbidity. Guidance issued by CDC on active monitoring was a cornerstone of its response to the West Africa Ebola outbreak. There are limited data on how to balance the costs and performance of this important public health activity. We present a framework that estimates the risks and costs of specific durations of active monitoring for pathogens of significant public health concern. We analyze data from New York City's Ebola active monitoring program over a 16-month period in 2014-2016. For monitored individuals, we identified unique durations of active monitoring that minimize expected costs for those at “low (but not zero) risk” and “some or high risk”: 21 and 31 days, respectively. Extending our analysis to smallpox and MERS-CoV, we found that the optimal length of active monitoring relative to the median incubation period was reduced compared to Ebola due to less variable incubation periods. Active monitoring can save lives but is expensive. Resources can be most effectively allocated by using exposure-risk categories to modify the duration or intensity of active monitoring.

    Objective: To determine the effect of mandatory and nonmandatory influenza vaccination policies on vaccination rates and symptomatic absenteeism among healthcare personnel (HCP).
    Design: Retrospective observational cohort study.
    Setting: This study took place at 3 university medical centers with mandatory influenza vaccination policies and 4 Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare systems with nonmandatory influenza vaccination policies.
    Participants: The study included 2,304 outpatient HCP at mandatory vaccination sites and 1,759 outpatient HCP at nonmandatory vaccination sites.
    Methods: To determine the incidence and duration of absenteeism in outpatient settings, HCP participating in the Respiratory Protection Effectiveness Clinical Trial at both mandatory and nonmandatory vaccination sites over 3 viral respiratory illness (VRI) seasons (2012–2015) reported their influenza vaccination status and symptomatic days absent from work weekly throughout a 12-week period during the peak VRI season each year. The adjusted effects of vaccination and other modulating factors on absenteeism rates were estimated using multivariable regression models.
    Results: The proportion of participants who received influenza vaccination was lower each year at nonmandatory than at mandatory vaccination sites (odds ratio [OR], 0.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.07–0.11). Among HCP who reported at least 1 sick day, vaccinated HCP had lower symptomatic days absent compared to unvaccinated HCP (OR for 2012–2013 and 2013–2014, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72–0.93; OR for 2014–2015, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69–0.95).
    Conclusions: These data suggest that mandatory HCP influenza vaccination policies increase influenza vaccination rates and that HCP symptomatic absenteeism diminishes as rates of influenza vaccination increase. These findings should be considered in formulating HCP influenza vaccination policies.

  abstract: >
    Creating statistical models that generate accurate predictions of infectious disease incidence over multiple time points is a challenging problem whose solution could benefit public health decision makers. We develop a new approach to this problem using kernel conditional density estimation (KCDE) and copulas. We obtain predictive distributions for incidence in individual weeks using KCDE and tie those distributions together into joint distributions using copulas. This strategy enables us to create predictions for the timing of and incidence in the peak week of the season. Our implementation of KCDE incorporates two novel kernel components: a periodic component that captures seasonality in disease incidence, and a component that allows for a full parameterization of the bandwidth matrix with discrete variables. We demonstrate via simulation that a fully parameterized bandwidth matrix can be beneficial for estimating conditional densities. We apply the method to predicting dengue fever and influenza, and compare to a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model and a previously published generalized linear model for infectious disease incidence known as HHH4. KCDE outperforms the baseline methods for predictions of dengue incidence in individual weeks. KCDE also offers more consistent performance than the baseline models for predictions of incidence in the peak week, and is comparable to the baseline models on the other prediction targets. Using the periodic kernel function led to better predictions of incidence. Our approach and extensions of it could yield improved predictions for public health decision makers, particularly in diseases with heterogeneous seasonal dynamics such as dengue fever.

  abstract: >
    The rapid emergence of infectious disease outbreaks from both new and known pathogens remains a critical concern of health officials worldwide. Improving communication between teams of scientific researchers who assemble forecasts of outbreaks before and during epidemics, and policy makers who could integrate these data into decicion-making has been identified as a critical area for innovation.(Chretien et al. 2015) In an attempt to address this issue, we have developed flusight, a tool for visualizing infectious disease forecasts. It provides an interactive interface for real-time comparison, exploration, and evaluation of infectious disease forecast models over time and geographic regions. A version is live here, with forecasts of influenza in the US that are updated weekly during the US influenza season. Flusight uses D3 (Bostock 2016) for generating visualizations from a single static file that summarizes the entities to be visualized (such as, predicted and actual weekly influenza incidence, predicted week with the peak incidence for the season, etc...). It is written to keep hosting overhead minimal and pre-generates the data file by parsing model predictions and live influenza data from delphi-API (undefx 2016). All content is bundled into a static web page. The data collection step can be replaced to visualize data and forecasts from custom sources instead of the ones used in the current repository. This allows future users to plug in similar time-series-based disease prediction models for visualization. This application has potential to be widely used by infectious disease forecasters who generate forecasts in real-time. In this way, we hope that flusight will facilitate dissemination, comparison, and standardized evaluation of outbreak predictions.

    Confidence intervals provide a way to determine plausible values for a population parameter. They are omnipresent in research articles involving statistical analyses. Appropriately, a key statistical literacy learning objective is the ability to interpret and understand confidence intervals in a wide range of settings. As instructors, we devote a considerable amount of time and effort to ensure that students master this topic in introductory courses and beyond. Yet, studies continue to find that confidence intervals are commonly misinterpreted and that even experts have trouble calibrating their individual confidence levels. In this article, we present a ten-minute trivia game-based activity that addresses these misconceptions by exposing students to confidence intervals from a personal perspective. We describe how the activity can be integrated into a statistics course as a one-time activity or with repetition at intervals throughout a course, discuss results of using the activity in class, and present possible extensions.

    Epidemics of communicable diseases place a huge burden on public health
    infrastructures across the world. Producing accurate and actionable
    forecasts of infectious disease incidence at short and long time scales will
    improve public health response to outbreaks. However, scientists and public
    health officials face many obstacles in trying to create such real-time
    forecasts of infectious disease incidence. Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus
    that annually infects over 400 million people worldwide. We developed a
    real-time forecasting model for dengue hemorrhagic fever in the 77 provinces
    of Thailand. We created a practical computational infrastructure that
    generated multi-step predictions of dengue incidence in Thai provinces every
    two weeks throughout 2014. These predictions show mixed performance across
    provinces, out-performing seasonal baseline models in over half of provinces
    at a 1.5 month horizon. Additionally, to assess the degree to which delays
    in case reporting make long-range prediction a challenging task, we compared
    the performance of our real-time predictions with predictions made with
    fully reported data. This paper provides valuable lessons for the
    implementation of real-time predictions in the context of public health
    decision making.

    Dengue viruses, which infect millions of people per year worldwide, cause large epidemics that strain healthcare systems. Despite diverse efforts to develop forecasting tools including autoregressive time series, climate-driven statistical, and mechanistic biological models, little work has been done to understand the contribution of different components to improved prediction. We developed a framework to assess and compare dengue forecasts produced from different types of models and evaluated the performance of seasonal autoregressive models with and without climate variables for forecasting dengue incidence in Mexico. Climate data did not significantly improve the predictive power of seasonal autoregressive models. Short-term and seasonal autocorrelation were key to improving short-term and long-term forecasts, respectively. Seasonal autoregressive models captured a substantial amount of dengue variability, but better models are needed to improve dengue forecasting. This framework contributes to the sparse literature of infectious disease prediction model evaluation, using state-of-the-art validation techniques such as out-of-sample testing and comparison to an appropriate reference model.

    Statistical prediction models inform decision-making processes in many
    real-world settings. Prior to using predictions in practice, one must
    rigorously test and validate candidate models to ensure that the proposed
    predictions have sufficient accuracy to be used in practice. In this
    article, we present a framework for evaluating time series predictions,
    which emphasizes computational simplicity and an intuitive interpretation
    using the relative mean absolute error metric. For a single time series,
    this metric enables comparisons of candidate model predictions against naïve
    reference models, a method that can provide useful and standardized
    performance benchmarks. Additionally, in applications with multiple time
    series, this framework facilitates comparisons of one or more models’
    predictive performance across different sets of data. We illustrate the use
    of this metric with a case study comparing predictions of dengue hemorrhagic
    fever incidence in two provinces of Thailand. This example demonstrates the
    utility and interpretability of the relative mean absolute error metric in
    practice, and underscores the practical advantages of using relative
    performance metrics when evaluating predictions.

    OBJECTIVE: To estimate the timing of key events in the natural history of Zika virus infection. METHODS: In February 2016, we searched PubMed, Scopus and the Web of Science for publications containing the term Zika. By pooling data, we estimated the incubation period, the time to seroconversion and the duration of viral shedding. We estimated the risk of Zika virus contaminated blood donations. FINDINGS: We identified 20 articles on 25 patients with Zika virus infection. The median incubation period for the infection was estimated to be 5.9 days (95% credible interval, CrI: 4.4-7.6), with 95% of people who developed symptoms doing so within 11.2 days (95% CrI: 7.6-18.0) after infection. On average, seroconversion occurred 9.1 days (95% CrI: 7.0-11.6) after infection. The virus was detectable in blood for 9.9 days (95% CrI: 6.9-21.4) on average. Without screening, the estimated risk that a blood donation would come from an infected individual increased by approximately 1 in 10 000 for every 1 per 100 000 person-days increase in the incidence of Zika virus infection. Symptom-based screening may reduce this rate by 7% (relative risk, RR: 0.93; 95% CrI: 0.89-0.99) and antibody screening, by 29% (RR: 0.71; 95% CrI: 0.28-0.88). CONCLUSION: Neither symptom- nor antibody-based screening for Zika virus infection substantially reduced the risk that blood donations would be contaminated by the virus. Polymerase chain reaction testing should be considered for identifying blood safe for use in pregnant women in high-incidence areas.

    Although N95 filtering facepiece respirators and medical masks are commonly used for protection against respiratory infections in healthcare settings, more clinical evidence is needed to understand the optimal settings and exposure circumstances for healthcare personnel to use these devices. A lack of clinically germane research has led to equivocal, and occasionally conflicting, healthcare respiratory protection recommendations from public health organizations, professional societies, and experts. The Respiratory Protection Effectiveness Clinical Trial (ResPECT) is a prospective comparison of respiratory protective equipment to be conducted at multiple U.S. study sites. Healthcare personnel who work in outpatient settings will be cluster-randomized to wear N95 respirators or medical masks for protection against infections during respiratory virus season. Outcome measures will include laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections, acute respiratory illness, and influenza-like illness. Participant exposures to patients, coworkers, and others with symptoms and signs of respiratory infection, both within and beyond the workplace, will be recorded in daily diaries. Adherence to study protocols will be monitored by the study team. ResPECT is designed to better understand the extent to which N95s and MMs reduce clinical illness among healthcare personnel. A fully successful study would produce clinically relevant results that help clinician-leaders make reasoned decisions about protection of healthcare personnel against occupationally acquired respiratory infections and prevention of spread within healthcare systems.

    Early, accurate predictions of the onset of influenza season enable targeted
    implementation of control efforts. Our objective was to develop a tool to
    assist public health practitioners, researchers, and clinicians in defining
    the community-level onset of seasonal influenza epidemics. Using recent
    surveillance data on virologically confirmed infections of influenza, we
    developed the Above Local Elevated Respiratory Illness Threshold (ALERT)
    algorithm, a method to identify the period of highest seasonal influenza
    activity. We used data from 2 large hospitals that serve Baltimore, Maryland
    and Denver, Colorado, and the surrounding geographic areas. The data used by
    ALERT are routinely collected surveillance data: weekly case counts of
    laboratory-confirmed influenza A virus. The main outcome is the percentage
    of prospective seasonal influenza cases identified by the ALERT algorithm.
    When ALERT thresholds designed to capture 90% of all cases were applied
    prospectively to the 2011–2012 and 2012–2013 influenza seasons in both
    hospitals, 71%–91% of all reported cases fell within the ALERT period. The
    ALERT algorithm provides a simple, robust, and accurate metric for
    determining the onset of elevated influenza activity at the community level.
    This new algorithm provides valuable information that can impact infection
    prevention recommendations, public health practice, and healthcare delivery.

  abstract: >
    The frequency of cluster-randomized trials (CRTs) in peer-reviewed literature has increased exponentially over the past two decades. CRTs are a valuable tool for studying interventions that cannot be effectively implemented or randomized at the individual level. However, some aspects of the design and analysis of data from CRTs are more complex than those for individually randomized controlled trials. One of the key components to designing a successful CRT is calculating the proper sample size (i.e. number of clusters) needed to attain an acceptable level of statistical power. In order to do this, a researcher must make assumptions about the value of several variables, including a fixed mean cluster size. In practice, cluster size can often vary dramatically. Few studies account for the effect of cluster size variation when assessing the statistical power for a given trial. We conducted a simulation study to investigate how the statistical power of CRTs changes with variable cluster sizes. In general, we observed that increases in cluster size variability lead to a decrease in power.

    Dengue, a mosquito-borne virus of humans, infects over 50 million people
    annually. Infection with any of the four dengue serotypes induces protective
    immunity to that serotype, but does not confer long-term protection against
    infection by other serotypes. The immunological interactions between
    serotypes are of central importance in understanding epidemiological
    dynamics and anticipating the impact of dengue vaccines. We analysed a
    38-year time series with 12 197 serotyped dengue infections from a hospital
    in Bangkok, Thailand. Using novel mechanistic models to represent different
    hypothesized immune interactions between serotypes, we found strong evidence
    that infection with dengue provides substantial short-term cross-protection
    against other serotypes (approx. 1–3 years). This is the first quantitative
    evidence that short-term cross-protection exists since human experimental
    infection studies performed in the 1950s. These findings will impact
    strategies for designing dengue vaccine studies, future multi-strain
    modelling efforts, and our understanding of evolutionary pressures in
    multi-strain disease systems.

    In recent years, the number of studies using a cluster-randomized design has
    grown dramatically. In addition, the cluster-randomized crossover design has
    been touted as a methodological advance that can increase efficiency of
    cluster-randomized studies in certain situations. While the
    cluster-randomized crossover trial has become a popular tool, standards of
    design, analysis, reporting and implementation have not been established for
    this emergent design. We address one particular aspect of cluster-randomized
    and cluster-randomized crossover trial design: estimating statistical power.
    We present a general framework for estimating power via simulation in
    cluster-randomized studies with or without one or more crossover periods. We
    have implemented this framework in the clusterPower software package for R,
    freely available online from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. Our
    simulation framework is easy to implement and users may customize the
    methods used for data analysis. We give four examples of using the software
    in practice. The clusterPower package could play an important role in the
    design of future cluster-randomized and cluster-randomized crossover
    studies. This work is the first to establish a universal method for
    calculating power for both cluster-randomized and cluster-randomized
    clinical trials. More research is needed to develop standardized and
    recommended methodology for cluster-randomized crossover studies.
