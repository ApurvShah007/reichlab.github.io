        <h3>Disease forecasting</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="card-body">
        Our team is working to develop statistical methods and tools that can
        improve real-time infectious disease forecasting efforts for a variety
        of diseases, including dengue fever and influenza. For example, in a
        collaboration with the Ministry of Public Health in Thailand, our team
        has built statistical forecast models to
        <a href="http://works.bepress.com/nicholas_reich/13/">predict outbreaks
        of dengue fever in real-time</a> since early 2014 for each of the 77
        provinces in Thailand. These forecasts are based on over 2 million
        unique reported case records of dengue fever in Thailand since 1968.

        <h3>Statistical Methods for Pathogen Interactions</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="card-body">
        In multi-pathogen infectious disease systems, complex immunological
        interactions between multiple strains of disease govern the evolutionary
        and epidemiological dynamics of disease. Understanding these
        interactions plays a vital role in clinical and public health
        decision-making. Our work combines multiple data streams from complex
        disease systems with modern statistical and computational methodologies
        to find evidence of complex interactions within the system. For example,
        <a href="http://works.bepress.com/nicholas_reich/12/">our research</a> was
        the first to use population-level data to explicitly estimate the
        duration of temporary immunity experienced by individuals after an
        infection with one of the four serotypes of dengue fever.

        <h3>Cluster-randomized Trial Design</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="card-body">
        Cluster-randomized trials are a type of clinical trial where clusters of
        individuals are randomized instead of individuals. In our work on
        several high-profile cluster-randomized clinical trials -- including the
        ResPECT Study (funded by CDC and VA), the SCRUB Trial, and a telehealth
        collaborative care trial for HIV patients (funded by VA) -- we have
        developed simulation methods for calculating power for
        cluster-randomized and cluster-randomized crossover trials. These
        methods are available as an R software package,
        <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/clusterPower/index.html">

        <h3>Estimating Incubation Period Distributions</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="card-body">
        The incubation period -- the length of time between infection with a
        pathogen and the onset of symptoms -- plays a vital role in the
        prevention and control of infectious disease. Estimating the incubation
        period can be challenging because often both the time of infection and
        the time of onset are not observed exactly. Our work has developed
        robust statistical methods to estimate the full duration of the
        incubation period. Recent work focuses on characterizing the uncertainty
        in incubation period estimates in ways that could assist in creating
        evidence-based quarantine policies for infectious diseases, such as
        Ebola or influenza.
