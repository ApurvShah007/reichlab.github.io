Our team is working to develop statistical methods and tools that can improve
real-time infectious disease forecasting efforts for a variety of diseases,
including dengue fever and influenza. For example, in a collaboration with the
Ministry of Public Health in Thailand, our team has built statistical forecast
models
to
[predict outbreaks of dengue fever in real-time](http://works.bepress.com/nicholas_reich/13/) since
early 2014 for each of the 77 provinces in Thailand. These forecasts are based
on over 2 million unique reported case records of dengue fever in Thailand since
1968.
