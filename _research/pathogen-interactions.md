In multi-pathogen infectious disease systems, complex immunological interactions
between multiple strains of disease govern the evolutionary and epidemiological
dynamics of disease. Understanding these interactions plays a vital role in
clinical and public health decision-making. Our work combines multiple data
streams from complex disease systems with modern statistical and computational
methodologies to find evidence of complex interactions within the system. For
example, [our research](http://works.bepress.com/nicholas_reich/12/) was the
first to use population-level data to explicitly estimate the duration of
temporary immunity experienced by individuals after an infection with one of the
four serotypes of dengue fever.
