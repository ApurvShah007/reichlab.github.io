The incubation period -- the length of time between infection with a pathogen and
the onset of symptoms -- plays a vital role in the prevention and control of
infectious disease. Estimating the incubation period can be challenging because
often both the time of infection and the time of onset are not observed exactly.
Our work has developed robust statistical methods to estimate the full duration
of the incubation period. Recent work focuses on characterizing the uncertainty
in incubation period estimates in ways that could assist in creating
evidence-based quarantine policies for infectious diseases, such as Ebola or
influenza.
