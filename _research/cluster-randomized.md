Cluster-randomized trials are a type of clinical trial where clusters of
individuals are randomized instead of individuals. In our work on several
high-profile cluster-randomized clinical trials -- including the ResPECT Study
(funded by CDC and VA), the SCRUB Trial, and a telehealth collaborative care
trial for HIV patients (funded by VA) -- we have developed simulation methods for
calculating power for cluster-randomized and cluster-randomized crossover
trials. These methods are available as an R software
package,
[clusterPower](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/clusterPower/index.html).
