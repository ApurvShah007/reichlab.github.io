Our team is working to develop statistical methods and tools that can improve
real-time infectious disease forecasting efforts for a variety of diseases,
including dengue fever and influenza. For example, in a collaboration with the
Ministry of Public Health in Thailand, our team has built statistical forecast
models
to
[predict outbreaks of dengue fever in real-time](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0004761) since
early 2014 for each of the 77 provinces in Thailand. These forecasts are based
on over 2.5 million unique reported case records of dengue fever in Thailand since 1968. We also have developed [novel ensemble methodologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10936) to improve the reliability of forecasts for public health decision makers.
