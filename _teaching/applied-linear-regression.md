The aim of this course (BIOSTATS 690NR) is to provide fundamental statistical
concepts and tools relevant to the practice implementing linear regression. This
course develops students knowledge of a classic tool of applied biostatistics
while introducing them to more advanced concepts such as simulation, sensitivity
analyses, and missing data. (Typically offered in the spring semester.)
