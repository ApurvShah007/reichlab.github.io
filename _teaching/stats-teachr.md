Co-founded by Nick Reich, [statsTeachR.org](http://statsTeachR.org) is an online
repository for open-access educational resources for teaching statistics using
R. Focused on resources for the undergraduate and graduate levels,
statsTeachR.org serves as a central repository for user-contributed teaching
``modules'', designed by teachers and for teachers, with an eye towards
topic-specific, hands-on, lab-oriented, interactive learning of statistics using
R. statsTeachR has received support from the NSF-funded MOSAIC project for
teaching statistics.
